Check out my free Ruby Course [Here]
(https://programmingplusplus.thinkific.com/courses/learn-rails-beginner)

Alright if anyone is interested in learning Ruby Programming (A must if you want
to learn Ruby on Rails).  I created a Free Video course at the link below.  No
Youtube Adds, no paid subscription, nothing.  You can also ask questions which I
will respond promptly too.  The videos are short, concise and down to earth.  NO
PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE REQUIRED.  This course is exactly what you need to know
to start writing effective code.

Why am I doing this?  I have been teaching ever since I assisted teaching
Geometry in High School.  I was a Teacher Assistant in College and always found
it valuable that if you explained material to others, You internalized that
concept more.

Bye for now!
